üîπ 1. @GetMapping("/employees")

This maps the URL /employees to this method.

So when someone opens http://localhost:8080/employees, Spring Boot calls this function.

üîπ 2. public String getAllEmployees(Model model)

Model is a Spring object that passes data from backend ‚Üí to Thymeleaf HTML page.

Whatever you model.addAttribute(...) here will be available in your employees.html.

üîπ 3. List<Employee> employeeList = employeeRepo.findAll();

This calls MongoDB repository ‚Üí findAll() ‚Üí gets all employees from DB.

Stores them in employeeList.

üîπ 4. model.addAttribute("employees", employeeList);

Puts the list of employees into the model.

In Thymeleaf, you can access it like:

<tr th:each="emp : ${employee}">
    <td th:text="${emp.name}"></td>
</tr>


üîπ 5. model.addAttribute("employee", new Employee());

Adds a blank Employee object to the model.

This is useful for forms ‚Üí Thymeleaf can bind form inputs to this object.

Example:

<form th:action="@{/employees}" th:object="${employee}" method="post">
    <input type="text" th:field="*{name}" />
    <input type="text" th:field="*{role}" />
</form>

üîπ 6. model.addAttribute("confiramationForm", new ConfirmationForm());

This adds another object ‚Üí ConfirmationForm.

Maybe this is for a confirmation step (like ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to delete this employee?‚Äù).

In HTML, you could bind it like:

<form th:object="${confiramationForm}">
    <input type="hidden" th:field="*{employeeId}" />
    <button type="submit">Confirm</button>
</form>

üîπ 7. return "employees";

This tells Spring to render the employees.html page (from src/main/resources/templates/).

The model data you added will be accessible in that HTML.
üîπ Step by Step Explanation

@PostMapping("/create")

This method runs when someone submits the employee form with action = /create.

Example:

<form th:action="@{/create}" th:object="${employee}" method="post">


public String newEmployee(Employee employee, Model model)

Spring automatically maps form fields to the Employee object (thanks to th:object="${employee}" + th:field="*{...}").

Model is used to pass new data back to the page.

model.addAttribute("employee", new Employee());

After saving, it puts a fresh empty employee object in the model.

This makes sure the form fields are cleared for the next entry.

Dynamic Employee ID

String empId = "EMP";
Random random = new Random();
long randomNumber = 1000 + random.nextInt(9000);
empId = empId + randomNumber;
employee.setId(empId);


Since MongoDB doesn‚Äôt generate custom IDs automatically, you‚Äôre manually generating one like EMP1234.

nextInt(9000) generates 0‚Äì8999 ‚Üí then you add 1000 ‚Üí so IDs are always between EMP1000 ‚Äì EMP9999.

Save Employee

employeeRepo.save(employee);


Saves the object into your employee collection in MongoDB.

Return

return "redirect:/";


After saving, it redirects to the home page / (maybe your employees.html list page).

üîπ Why is it different from earlier CRUD code I gave you?

In your code, you‚Äôre:

Generating custom IDs (EMPxxxx)

Using "redirect:/" instead of "redirect:/employees"

Clearing the form immediately after submission

This is still correct ‚úÖ ‚Äî just a more customized CRUD flow.

‚ö° Suggestion (Better Practice)

Instead of overwriting model.addAttribute("employee", new Employee()); in the same method, you can just redirect and let the GET handler prepare the empty object. Example:

@PostMapping("/create")
public String newEmployee(@ModelAttribute("employee") Employee employee) {
    // Generate Employee ID
    String empId = "EMP" + (1000 + new Random().nextInt(9000));
    employee.setId(empId);

    employeeRepo.save(employee);

    return "redirect:/employees";  // safer than "/"
}


Then in your GET handler:

@GetMapping("/employees")
public String getAllEmployees(Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("employees", employeeRepo.findAll());
    model.addAttribute("employee", new Employee()); // for form
    return "employees";
}


‚úÖ This way:

/employees shows the list + form

/create inserts employee and redirects back

Cleaner separation of responsibilities
